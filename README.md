# Noiseprint: a CNN-based camera model fingerprint
[Noiseprint](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8713484) is a CNN-based camera model fingerprint
extracted by a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Installation :wrench:
The code requires Python 3.5 and Tensorflow 1.2.1 .
In order to install everything that is needed, create and activate a conda environment through the following command:
```
conda create -n noiseprint python=3.5 pip
conda activate noiseprint
```

### Installation with GPU
Install Cuda8 and Cudnn5, more informetion on sites:
- https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
- https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Then install the requested libraries using:
```
cat noiseprint/requirements-gpu.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
```

### Installation without GPU
Install the requested libraries using:
```
cat noiseprint/requirements-cpu.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
```

## Usage :key:
- Firstly, the dataset has to be included in the `data` folder.
- Within the `Dataset`, each camera's images must be contained in its respective folder, named as `Brand_Model_CameraLocation_ID`, where camera location is either *Frontal* or *Rear*. In particular, they should be divided into separate `Train` and `Test` splits.
- The images belonging to a specific camera should have the name in the form *Brand_Model_CamLocation_ID_Content_X.jpg*, where 'Content' identifies the image type (*flat* or *natural*) and 'X' is an incremental number (example: *Apple_iPadmini5_Frontal_0_Nat_0.jpg*). 

To compute the fingerprints of the cameras:

```
python3 compute_fingerprints.py -c dimension_squared_crop_size
```

You can choose the crop size used for computing the noiseprints with the parameter `-c`.
To test the performance of the method, run:

```
python3 test.py -c dimension_squared_crop_size
```

The noiseprints of the cameras are saved in the `noiseprints` directory, while the charts showing the performance of the method are saved in the `plot` folder.

## How it works :gear:
### Training
The noiseprint characterizing each device is computed by making the average over the noiseprints of the images belonging to the specific device.

### Testing
A pairwise comparison is performed between the noiseprints of the test images and the reference patterns of the cameras using the Euclidean Distance as a similarity metric.
Each test image is assigned to the camera showing the lowest euclidean distance with respect to the noiseprint residual of the test image.
